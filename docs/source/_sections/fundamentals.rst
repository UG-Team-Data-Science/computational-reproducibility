Computational reproducibility means that research results obtained through computation (simulations, data analyses, machine learning, etc.) can be consistently re-produced by others (or the same researcher in the future) given the same inputs and methods. It ensures that findings are verifiable, transparent, and reliable.

Benefits of Computational Reproducibility
-----------------------------------------

1. Integrity and Trust
2. Efficiency and Reuse
3. Collaboration and Transparency
4. `Long-term` Preservation
5. Scalability and Generalization
6. Policy and Funding Compliance
